## Unsolved problems and hurdles overcame

Problems that went unsolved was the concept I had for the game. I wanted a candle light to be visible on the side and everytime a word was guessed incorrectly, the candle light would get dimmer and dimmer until you eventually ran out of lives. Then, I wanted to create a ranking system that would increase your rank to either bronze, gold, or platinium depending on the amount of wins the player accumulated. I also wanted different categories the player could go through but I couldn't get to that either.

Major hurdles I overcame were the keyboard input resignating with the words hidden within the underscores. This part consumed most of my time, partly because I didn't start earlier and also because it was more challenging than I thought it would be. Eventually, with the help of Esin and Riana from office hours, I finally overcame that obstacle and felt a sense of accomplishment and relief.
